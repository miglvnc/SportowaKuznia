Sportowa Kuźnia is one of my first project created fully in **HTML/CSS(SASS)/JavaScript**. The website focus mainly at fitness lifestyle, training routine, diets etc.

The website's visitors can find a several sections: 

## Diets
Users are able to compose their own diet or choose prepared meals ideas. If they choose the first option, a new window will appear. There visitors can compose their own diets by clicking products from the table. Users can use search option to find intresting product, sort data through values and add product to separate table. More details are placed in website.
