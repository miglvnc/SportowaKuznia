# Fitness Website - Sportowa Kuźnia

Sportowa Kuźnia is one of my first project created fully in **HTML/CSS(SASS)/JavaScript**. The website focus mainly at fitness lifestyle, training routine, diets etc.

The website's visitors can find a several sections: 

## Diets
Users are able to compose their own diet or choose prepared meals ideas. If they choose the first option, a new window will appear. There visitors can compose their own diets by clicking products from the table. Users can use search option to find intresting product, sort data through values and add product to separate table. More details are placed in website.

Table with choosen products dynamicaly sums all values depends on provided 'weight of product' by the user. At the bottom of table, there is an area with total values. To remove product from table, user have to just click the selected product.

Moreover, column with inputs are hidden in mobile devices (width). By clicking switch button, user is able to visible hidden column.
